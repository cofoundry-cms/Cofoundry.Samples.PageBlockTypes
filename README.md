# Cofoundry.Samples.PageBlockTypes

A bare website showing various examples of how to implement page block types.

If you have any requests for example block types, [let us know](https://github.com/cofoundry-cms/cofoundry/wiki/Feedback-&-Community).

#### To get started:

1. Create a database named 'Cofoundry.Samples.PageBlockTypes' and check the Cofoundry connection string in the config file is correct for you sql server instance
2. Run the website and navigate to *"/admin"*, which will display the setup screen
3. Enter an application name and setup your user account. Submit the form to complete the site setup. 
4. Log in and add a page with the *General* template, click on save and edit to go to the visual editor and play around with the page block types.

####  Example Page Block Types:

- **Carousel:** A multi-item carousel making use of `NestedDataModelCollection` to allow editing of a collection of slides.
- **ContentSection:** An example of a block type hosted in a separate project
- **DirectoryList:** Lists pages in a specific directory. Demonstrates searching for pages using `IPageRepository` and using the `WebDirectoryAttribute` data model attribute.
- **HorizontalLine:** A very simple block type that adds a variable width horizontal line (wrapped hr tag).
- **PageList:** An orderable list of links to pages. Demonstrates querying for cached page routes using `IPageRepository`, the `PageCollectionAttribute` data model attribute and generating links to pages from page objects.
- **PageSnippet:** Displays summary information about a page. Demonstrates the `PageAttribute` data model attribute, querying and manipulating block data and handling availability of linked entities (due to draft status).
- **Quotation:** A quotation block that is output as blockquote with an optional cite tag.
- **SocialProfiles:** An example of using `NestedDataModelMultiTypeCollection` to create a list of social media profile links by utilizing four different types of nested data models in one collection.
- **TextList:** A list of text items that displays in an html unordered list, or optional in an ordered list.

## ExampleSharedProject

The solution also contains a project that demonstrates how to organise page blocks into a shared project. If you're implementing your own shared project for block types, there are some rules you need to follow:

- Ensure your project is named in a way it can be picked up by DI: check the relevant section of the [dependency injection docs](https://www.cofoundry.org/docs/framework/dependency-injection#registering-dependencies-in-other-assemblies) for more information.
- Ensure any view files are marked as embedded resources. This can be done either through the Visual Studio UI, or by adding a generic rule to your `.csproj` file:

```
<ItemGroup>
    <EmbeddedResource Include="**\*.cshtml;" />
</ItemGroup>
```
- Include an `IAssemblyResourceRegistration` implementation: This tells Cofoundry that your assembly contains embedded resources that need to included in the solution.
- Ensure view files are located in one of the default view block type folders, or implement your own `IPageBlockTypeViewLocationRegistration` if you want to namespace it under a custom path to avoid conflicts. See the [page block types docs](https://www.cofoundry.org/docs/content-management/page-block-types#file-location) for more info.
- Note that with embedded resources, files in your main project will override embedded resources in the same location in a dependent projects. This includes files like `_ViewImports.cshtml`, so it's best either to reference imports directly in your view file (as we have done in this example) or customize your block type view path to ensure it does not conflict.
